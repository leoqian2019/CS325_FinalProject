# CS325_FinalProject
### CSV Parser
This is the final project for my CS325 web development classs. This is a website that allows you to upload a csv file and preview the data in it via a JavaScript library called graphics. 

>CSV file of specific format is required.

To implement the project, you need to put the project directory on a machine that has a server environment set up like an Apache Server.
- In this case, PHP files can be turned into HTML page dynamically

After that, you would open homepage.html which allows you to register or login.

After logged in, you will see a dashboard page which you can upload file or see the graph from the data of the file you uploaded.

## Potential improvements
This website uses a very simple design to achieve the functionality of frontend and backend. 
There are a lot of ways to improve it such as making the design less redundant, add more error handling code, and add more features. 
However, this projects is a great way for people to learn how different websites are structured since no matter how complex modern websites are, the core design principles/rules stay the same.
